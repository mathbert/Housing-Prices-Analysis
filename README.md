# Housing Prices Prediction and Seasonality Analysis 
 We used this repository for Empirical project in TIÃ˜4317 - Empirical and Quantitative Methods in Finance (Group 15).

 The repository includes a report, written in .ipynb and transformed to pdf file in a file named `Report.pdf`. The source file for this report is `report.ipynb` which also includes the code for all the plots and tables. If one is interested it can also look at the `comlpete_code.ipynb` which contains full code with more printed outputs which were not used in the final report.

In `Housing Prices Prediction and Seasonality Analysis.pptx` one can find our presentation which also includes audio recording.
